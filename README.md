# React-web-sample

  * This is the react web sample to show how we put fond-end and back-end structures together.

  * It integrated webpack, redux, redux-thunk and the npm run scripts to build production index.html.
  
  To run it:
  1. First time download the project, do "npm install && npm install --prefix client"
  2. * To run it locally, do "npm run dev"
     * To run it on server, do 
       1. "npm run postbuild"
       2. "node index.js"
